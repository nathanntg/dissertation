% TODO: write acknowledgements

The research presented here was only possible due to the support and 
contributions of many. I am especially grateful to all my 
colleagues and collaborators at both the Laboratory of Neural 
Circuit Formation and the Bio Optical \& Acoustic Spectroscopy Lab. 
Both labs provided close knit and collaborative environments; 
fellow researchers lent expertise, guidance and moral support 
that helped advance this work. A few lab members directly contributed 
to experiments, surgeries and research steps described in this 
thesis---specifically Dawit Semu, K{\i}v{\i}lc{\i}m K{\i}l{\i}\c{c}, 
Jun Shen, Blaire Lee and Will Liberti---and I am grateful to have
worked alongside each of them.

The faculty members throughout the University were an amazing resource, and I 
am appreciative of how willingly professors gave their time and 
knowledge. Tim Gardner lay the groundwork for this research and 
provided the inspiration for the techniques introduced in the 
thesis; he indulged my diverse research interests and provided a 
lab environment where I felt both intellectually challenged and 
encouraged. David Boas helped me bring this research to conclusion 
by filling in modeling and experimental gaps; his commitment to 
talking over progress and brainstorming next steps helped advance 
my work. In addition to my advisors, my committee and other 
faculty members provided valuable support and mentorship---I 
am especially appreciative of the contributions of Ian Davison
and Janusz Konrad.
