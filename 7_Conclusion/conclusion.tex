\section{Splaying optical microfibers as an interface}

\section{Future work}

This work has presented a new implant and technique
for deep brain imaging, along with a basic survey of 
relevant histology, modeling and initial recordings. 
But these are early steps, and future work will 
continue to adapt this technique to greater potential 
and new use cases.

\subsection{Additional in vivo recordings}

In \cref{chapter:recording}, we presented initial 
in vivo recordings showing fluorescence activity 
from intravenously injected fluorescent agents and 
from genetically encoded calcium indicators during 
both a cortical spreading depolarization and a 
forepaw stimulation experiment. The forepaw results 
are promising for
